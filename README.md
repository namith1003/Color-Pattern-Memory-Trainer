## Getting Started

### UI

At the bottom of the screen all the details regarding the level are displayed and how many colours your current level needs to be entered and how many you have entered are also shown.

### Rules

* A random colour sequence is shown.
* Correctly enter the sequence of colors.
* Repeat this the number of times the level required as stated at the bottom of your screen for the specific level.
* Once completed you will advance to the next level.
* Levels get increasingly difficult as the length of the random sequence gets longer and the number of times the sequence should be entered correctly also increases.
* If the sequence is entered incorrectly you will go down one level.
* If the sequence is entered incorrectly two levels in a row game is reset to level 1.
